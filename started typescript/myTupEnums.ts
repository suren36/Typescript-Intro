// Tuple is a fixed length array with fixed type elements. Tuple is a type in TypeScript that allows you to express an array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known, but need not be the same. For example, you may want to represent a value as a pair of a string and a number:
let rbg :[number,number,number] = [255,0,0]


type User =[name: string, id: number, live: boolean]

const newUser : User = ["suren",1,true]


export {}
